## 🚀 Project 1: Egypt Weather Parser

**Description:**  
A Python script that parses a CSV containing 25 years of weather data in Cairo. The script filters days with temperatures above 30°C, sorts them in descending order, and prints the top 5 hottest days.

**Script Output Example:**

| Rank | Date | Temperature (°C) |
|------|------|----------------|
| 1 | 2019-05-23 | 37.38 |
| 2 | 2018-05-22 | 36.82 |
| 3 | 2020-05-20 | 36.79 |
| 4 | 2021-08-05 | 36.44 |
